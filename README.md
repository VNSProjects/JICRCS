Currently, there are variety of websites that provide a lot of information about jobs and internship opportunities, but this task is incredibly time consuming for students because they must go through large amounts of data to find the appropriate job or internship. In addition, finding appropriate courses to build a skillset takes a long time and requires a lot of resources. The primary focus of our project is to build a portal that would help an individual to seek a job or internship based upon the parameters (choices) mentioned in the profile. Based upon the user ratings suitable jobs, internships or courses will be provided.
